## Abstract

A standard implementation of non-fungible tokens for the Aeternity ecosystem. The design goal of the primary interface is to be as compatible with ERC-721 as possible, so that anyone who can work with ERC-721 can work with this interface. However, where Sophia offers a better way, performance and efficiency should prevail over compatibility.

There is no support for unsafe transactions. Therefore all transactions are ought to be safe.

For minting it is expected that different options will evolve over time. The way minting is done has to be defined via extensions.

## Motivation

The following standard describes standard interfaces for non-fungible tokens. The proposal contains a primary interface and secondary interfaces for optional functionality that not everyone might need. 

# Basic NFT

## Interface

```sophia
contract interface NFT =
    datatype metadata_type = URL | OBJECT_ID | MAP
    datatype metadata = MetadataIdentifier(string) | MetadataMap(map(string, string))

    record meta_info = 
        { name: string
        , symbol: string 
        , base_url: option(string)
        , metadata_type : metadata_type}

    datatype event 
        = Transfer(address, address, int)
        | Approval(address, address, int, string)
        | ApprovalForAll(address, address, string)

    entrypoint aex141_extensions : () => list(string)

    entrypoint meta_info : () => meta_info

    entrypoint metadata : (int) => option(metadata)

    entrypoint balance : (address) => option(int)

    entrypoint total_supply : () => int

    entrypoint owner : (int) => option(address)
   
    stateful entrypoint transfer : (address, int, option(string)) => unit

    stateful entrypoint approve : (address, int, bool) => unit

    stateful entrypoint approve_all : (address, bool) => unit

    entrypoint get_approved : (int) => option(address)

    entrypoint is_approved : (int, address) => bool

    entrypoint is_approved_for_all : (address, address) => bool
```

## Methods

### aex141_extensions\(\)

**Returns** a hardcoded list of all implemented extensions on the deployed contract.

```sophia
entrypoint aex141_extensions() : list(string)
```

### meta_info\(\)

Returns meta information associated with the contract.

```sophia
entrypoint meta_info() : meta_info
```

| return | type |
| :--- | :--- |
| meta_info | meta_info |

### metadata\(\)

Returns metadata associated with an NFT. 
The function is a part of the basic interface, because metadata can be set in the constructor, 
as well as by implementing the Mintable extention.

```sophia
entrypoint metadata(token_id: int) : option(metadata)
```

| parameter | type |
| :--- | :--- |
| token_id | int |

| return | type |
| :--- | :--- |
| data | option(metadata) |

The `metadata` type to use depends on the `metadata_type` defined in the contract:
- for `URL` and `OBJECT_ID` use `MetadataIdentifier`
- for `MAP` use `MetadataMap`

### total_supply\(\)

Returns the total amount of NFTs in circulation.

```sophia
entrypoint total_supply() : Ã­nt
```

| return | type |
| :--- | :--- |
| total_supply | int |

### balance\(\)

Returns the account balance of another account with address `owner` if the account has a balance. If the owner address is unknown to the contract, `None` will be returned. Using `option` type as a return value allows us to determine if the account has balance of 0, more than 0, or the account has never had balance and is still unknown to the contract.

```sophia
entrypoint balance(owner: address) : option(int)
```

| parameter | type |
| :--- | :--- |
| owner | address |

| return | type |
| :--- | :--- |
| balance | option(int) |

### owner\(\)

Returns the owner's address for the provided `token_id` if the NFT is minted. If the NFT isn't minted, `None` will be returned. 

```sophia
entrypoint owner(token_id: int) : option(address)
```

| parameter | type |
| :--- | :--- |
| token_id | int |

| return | type |
| :--- | :--- |
| owner | option(address) |

### transfer\(\)
Transfers NFT with ID `token_id` from the current owner to the `to` address. Will invoke `NFTReceiver` if `to` address belongs to a contract. If provided, `data` will be submitted with the invocation of `NFTReceiver`. Emits the `Transfer` event.

Throws if:
- `Call.caller` is NOT the current owner or NOT approved to transfer on behalf of the owner;
- `token` is NOT a valid token;
- the invocation of `NFTReceiver` fails.

```sophia
stateful entrypoint transfer(to: address, token_id: int, data: option(string)) : unit
```

| parameter | type |
| :--- | :--- |
| to | address |
| token | int |
| data | option(string) |

### approve\(\)

Sets the `approved` address to interact on behalf of an owner for the NFT with ID `token_id`. If `enabled` is true the `operator` address is approved, if `false` the approval is revoked. Throws unless caller is the current NFT owner, or an authorized operator of the current owner. Emits the `Approval` event.

```sophia
stateful entrypoint approve(approved: address, token_id: int, enabled: bool) : unit
```

| parameter | type |
| :--- | :--- |
| approved | address |
| token_id | int |
| enabled | bool |

### approve_all\(\)

Enables or disables approval for an `operator` address to manage all of the caller's NFTs. If `enabled` is true, the `operator` address is approved, if `false`, the approval is revoked. Emits the `ApprovalForAll` event.

```sophia
stateful entrypoint approve_all(operator: address, enabled: bool) : unit
```

| parameter | type |
| :--- | :--- |
| operator | address |
| enabled | bool |

### get_approved\(\)

Returns the address approved to interact with the NFT with ID `token_id` or returns `None` if no approval has been set. Throws if NFT with ID `token_id` does not exist.

```sophia
entrypoint get_approved(token_id: int) : option(address)
``` 

| parameter | type |
| :--- | :--- |
| token_id | int |

| return | type |
| :--- | :--- |
| approved | option(address) |

### is_approved\(\)

Returns `true` if `approved` address is approved to transact for NFT with ID `token_id`.

```sophia
entrypoint is_approved(token_id: int, approved: address) : bool
``` 

| parameter | type |
| :--- | :--- |
| token_id | int |
| approved | address |

| return | type |
| :--- | :--- |
| approved | bool |
    
### is_approved_for_all\(\)

Returns `true` if `operator` is approved to commit transactions on behalf of `owner`.

Indicates wether an address is an authorized operator for another address.

```sophia
entrypoint is_approved_for_all(owner: address, operator: address) : bool
``` 

| parameter | type |
| :--- | :--- |
| owner | address |
| approved | address |

| return | type |
| :--- | :--- |
| approved | bool |
     
## Events

```sophia
datatype event 
        = Transfer(address, address, int)
        | Approval(address, address, int, string)
        | ApprovalForAll(address, address, string)
```

### *Transfer*

This event MUST be triggered and emitted when tokens are transferred.

The event arguments should be as follows: `(from, to, token_id)`

```sophia
Transfer(address, address, int)
```

| parameter | type |
| :--- | :--- |
| from | address |
| to | address |
| token_id | int |

### *Approval*

This event MUST be triggered and emitted upon approval, including revocation of approval.

The event arguments should be as follows: `(owner, approved, token_id, enabled)`.
Enabled is of type string, because of a limit of 3 on indexed values. Since address, int and bool are automatically indexed, having enabled as bool would cause an error, as it would be the 4th indexed item. Use `"true"` or `"false"` as return values instead.

```sophia
Approval(address, address, int, string)
```

| parameter | type |
| :--- | :--- |
| owner | address |
| approved | address |
| token_id | int |
| enabled | string |

### *ApprovalForAll*

This event MUST be triggered and emitted upon a change of operator status, including revocation of approval.

The event arguments should be as follows: `(owner, operator, approved)`

For idiomatic reasons `approved` is, just as with `Approval`, of type `string`

```sophia
ApprovalForAll(address, address, string)
```

| parameter | type |
| :--- | :--- |
| owner | address |
| operator | address |
| approved | string |

# Receiver contract interface

The standard only allows safe transfers of tokens. On transfer a check MUST be performed which checks if the recipient is a contract and if so the transfer MAY ONLY happen if `on_nft_received` returns true.

## NFTReceiver

```sophia
contract interface NFTReceiver = 
    entrypoint on_nft_received : (int, option(string)) => bool
```

### on_nft_received\(\)

Deals with receiving NFTs on behalf of a contract. Contracts MUST implement this interface to be able to receive NFTs. Mint and transfer transactions will invoke the `on_nft_received` function.

Returns `true` or `false` to signal whether processing the received NFT was successful or not.

```sophia
entrypoint on_nft_received(token_id: int, data: option(string)) : bool
```
| parameter | type |
| :--- | :--- |
| token_id | int |
| data | option(string) |

# Extensions

This section covers the extendability of the basic token - e.g. mintable, burnable.

When an NFT contract implements an extension its name should be included in the `aex141_extensions` array, in order for third party software or contracts to know the interface.
Any extensions should be implementable without permission. Developers of extensions MUST choose a name for `aex141_extensions` that is not yet used. Developers CAN make a pull request to the reference implementation for general purpose extensions and maintainers choose to eventually include them.

## Extension Mintable ("mintable")

### mint\(\)

Issues a new token to the provided address. If the `owner` is a contract, NFTReceiver will be called with `data` if provided.

Emits the `Mint` event.

Throws if the call to NFTReceiver implementation failed (safe transfer). 

```sophia
stateful entrypoint mint(owner: address, metadata: option(metadata), data: option(string)) : int
```

| parameter | type | 
| :--- | :--- | 
| owner | address |
| metadata | option(metadata) |
| data  | option(string) | 

| return | type |
| :--- | :--- |
| token_id | int |

### mint_cap\(\)

Returns the defined `mint_cap` which indicates the maximum supply the collection can potentially have. If unlimited minting is allowed, `None` MUST be returned.

```sophia
stateful entrypoint mint_cap() : option(int)
```

| return | type |
| :--- | :--- |
| mint_cap | option(int) |

## Extension Burnable ("burnable")

### burn\(\)

Burns the NFT with the provided `token_id`.

Emits the `Burn` event.

Throws if `Call.caller` is NOT the current owner or NOT approved to transfer on behalf of the owner.

```sophia
stateful entrypoint burn(token_id: int) : unit
```

| parameter | type |
| :--- | :--- |
| token_id | int |

## Extension Swappable ("swappable")

### swap\(\)

Burns all NFTs of `Call.caller` and stores the NFT ids in the swapped map.

```sophia
stateful entrypoint swap() : unit
```

### check_swap\(\)

Returns the amount of NFTs that were burned through `swap` for the provided account.

```sophia
stateful entrypoint check_swap(account: address) : int
```

| parameter | type |
| :--- | :--- |
| account | address |

| return | type |
| :--- | :--- |
| int | int |

### swapped\(\)

Returns the map with the swapped NFTs per address.

```sophia
stateful entrypoint swapped() : map(address, Set.set(int))
```

| return | type |
| :--- | :--- |
| swapped | map(address, Set.set(int)) |

## Extension Events

**Mint**

This event MUST be triggered whenever a new token is minted.

The event arguments should be as follows: `(to, token_id)`

```sophia
Mint(address, int)
```

| parameter | type |
| :--- | :--- |
| to | address |
| token_id | int |

**Burn** - MUST trigger when NFTs are burned using the `burn` function.

The burn event arguments should be as follows: `(owner, token_id)`

```sophia
Burn(address, int)
```

| parameter | type |
| :--- | :--- |
| owner | address |
| token_id | int |

**Swap** - MUST trigger for each NFT that is swapped using the `swap` function.

The swap event arguments should be as follows: `(owner,  token_id)`

```sophia
Swap(address, int)
```

| parameter | type |
| :--- | :--- |
| owner | address |
| token_id | int |
