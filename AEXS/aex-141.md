## Abstract

A standard implementation of non-fungible tokens for the Aeternity ecosystem. The design goal of the primary interface is to be as compatible with ERC-721 as possible, so that anyone who can work with ERC-721 can work with this interface. However, where Sophia offers a better way, performance and efficiency should prevail over compatibility.

There is no support for unsafe transactions. Therefore all transactions are ought to be safe.

## Motivation

The following standard describes standard interfaces for non-fungible tokens. The proposal contains a primary interface and secondary interfaces for optional functionality that not everyone might need. 

# Basic NFT

## Interface

```sophia
contract interface NFT =
    datatype metadata_type = URL | IPFS | OBJECT_ID | MAP
    datatype metadata = string | map(string,string)

    record meta_info = 
        { name: string
        , symbol: string 
        , base_url: option(string)
        , type : metadata_type)}

    datatype event 
        = Transfer(indexed address, indexed address, indexed int)
        | Approval(indexed address, indexed address, indexed int, bool)
        | ApprovalForAll(indexed address, indexed address, bool)

    entrypoint aex141_extensions() : list(string)

    entrypoint meta_info() : meta_info

    entrypoint metadata(int): option(metadata)

    stateful entrypoint mint : (address, option(string)) => int

    entrypoint balance : (address) => option(int)

    entrypoint owner : (int) => option(address)
        
    stateful transfer : (from address, to address, token int, data option(string)) => unit

    stateful entrypoint approve : (address, int, bool) => unit

    stateful entrypoint approve_all : (address, bool) => unit

    entrypoint get_approved : (int) => option(address)

    entrypoint is_approved : (int, address) => bool

    entrypoint is_approved_for_all : (address, address) => bool
```

## Methods

### aex141_extensions\(\)

This function **returns** a hardcoded list of all implemented extensions on the deployed contract.

```sophia
entrypoint aex141_extensions() : list(string)

### meta_info\(\)

Returns meta information associated with the token contract.

```sophia
entrypoint meta_info() : meta_info
```

| return | type |
| :--- | :--- |
| meta_info | meta_info |

### meta_data\(\)

Returns meta data associated with a token. The function is a part of the basic interface, because metadata can be set in the constructor, as well as by implementing the Mintable extention.

```sophia
entrypoint metadata(id int): option(metadata)
```

| parameter | type |
| :--- | :--- |
| id | int |

| return | type |
| :--- | :--- |
| data | option(metadata) |

### balance\(\)

Returns the account balance of another account with address `owner`, if the account exists. If the owner address is unknown to the contract `None` will be returned. Using `option` type as a return value allows us to determine if the account has balance of 0, more than 0, or the account has never had balance and is still unknown to the contract.

```sophia
entrypoint balance : (owner address) => int
```

| parameter | type |
| :--- | :--- |
| owner | address |

| return | type |
| :--- | :--- |
| balance | option(int) |

### owner\(\)

Returns the owner's address for the provided `token`, if the token is minted. If the token isn't minted `None` will be returned. 

```sophia
entrypoint owner : (token int) => option(address)
```

| parameter | type |
| :--- | :--- |
| token | int |

| return | type |
| :--- | :--- |
| owner | option(address) |

### transfer\(\)
Transfers `token` from the `from` address to the `to` address. Will invoke `NFTReceiver` if `to` is a contract receiver. If provided `data` will be submitted with the invocation of `NFTReceiver`. Emits the `Transfer` event.

Should throw if:
- `Call.caller` is not the current owner, an authorized operator or the approved address for this token;
- `from` isn't the current owner;
- `token` isn't a valid token;
- the invocation of `NFTReceiver` fails.

```sophia
stateful transfer : (from address, to address, token int, data option(string)) => unit
```

| parameter | type |
| :--- | :--- |
| from | address |
| to | address |
| token | int |
| data | option(string) |

### approve\(\)

Sets the `approved` address to interact on behalf of an owner for the `token`. If `enabled` is true the operator is approved, if `false` the approval is revoked. Throws unless caller is the current NFT owner, or an authorized operator of the current owner. Emits the `Approval` event.

```sophia
stateful entrypoint approve : (approved address, token int, enabled bool) => unit
```

| parameter | type |
| :--- | :--- |
| approved | address |
| token | int |
| enabled | bool |

### approve_all\(\)

Enables or disables approval for an `operator` to manage all of the caller's assets. If `enabled` is true the operator is approved, if `false` the approval is revoked. Emits the `ApprovalForAll` event.

```sophia
stateful entrypoint approve_all : (operator address, enabled bool) => unit
```

| parameter | type |
| :--- | :--- |
| operator | address |
| enabled | bool |

### get_approved\(\)

Returns the address approved to interact with the `token` or returns None if no approval has been set. Throws if `token` is an invalid token ID.

```sophia
entrypoint get_approved : (token int) => option(address)
``` 

| parameter | type |
| :--- | :--- |
| token | int |

| return | type |
| :--- | :--- |
| approved | option(address) |

### is_approved\(\)

Returns `true` if `approved` is approved to transact for `token`.

```sophia
entrypoint is_approved : (token int, approved address) => bool
``` 

| parameter | type |
| :--- | :--- |
| token | int |
| approved | address |

| return | type |
| :--- | :--- |
| approved | bool |
    
### is_approved_for_all\(\)

Returns `true` if `operator` is approved to commit transactions on behalf of `owner`.

Indicates wether an address is an authorized operator for another address.

```sophia
entrypoint is_approved_for_all : (owner address, operator address) => bool
``` 

| parameter | type |
| :--- | :--- |
| owner | address |
| approved | address |

| return | type |
| :--- | :--- |
| approved | bool |
