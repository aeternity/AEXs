## Simple Summary

The document approaches the technical specification about how a wallet provider (ex. BaseApp, Metamask) can interact with Aeternity enabled applications.

[Link to discussion topic](https://forum.aeternity.com/t/aex-2-js-sdk-interfaces-for-wallets/2715).

## Abstract

The specification address interfaces that the Javascript SDK exposes for a third party wallet provider can implement to provide functionalities like signing. The specification is meant to have a broad coverage for different scenarios like: browser extensions, iframes, native applications, deep linking, etc..

## Motivation

The motivation for the AEX is to provide to the community a clear, straightforward and safe way to interact with Ã¦ternity enabled applications that uses the Javascript SDK.

In this direction the goals that have been set for the specification are:

- generic: the proposal must cover as many as possible common uses cases
- secure: it should provide a safe model for communication between wallets and application
- simple: it should be easy to implement without much configuration or specific knowledge
- vendor free: it should not force the adoption of third party tools
- future proof: it should be extensible to support additional features

## Specification

The specification is divided in two main areas, the first one addresses applications running inside a browser or alike (ex. Electron) and the second one addresses deep linking.

### In Browser Applications

For in browser application the communication between `wallet <-> (sdk <-> app)` leverages the [Native messaging API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Native_messaging).

The advantages of using the _Native messaging API_ lies in the possibility of components to communicate independently from where they are being instantiated: a embedded iFrame can communicate with the parent page as well as a browser extension or a custom browser implementation.

Since the messages via _Native messaging API_ are broadcasted, the communication between the SDK and a Wallet provider are encrypted using the [nacl box](https://nacl.cr.yp.to/box.html) implementation with throwaway keys.
For secruity model and selected primitives, please refer [here](https://nacl.cr.yp.to/box.html).

#### Workflow

The workflow of the interaction between the App + SDK is divided in 3 phases:

1. Handshake
2. Operation
3. De-registration

In the operation phase the SDK and the Wallet will be exchanging encrypted data relative to signing end broadcasting transactions.

The deregistration phase is optional but allows a wallet provider to
notifiy the SDK (and the app) that the wallet has been disconnected.

#### Communication Examples

##### Provider Registration (Handshake)

![Register Provider][register]

##### Transaction Signing (example operation)

![Sign TX][sign]

[sign]: ../assets/aex-2/wallet-signing.png "Sign Transaction"
[register]: ../assets/aex-2/provider-registration.png "Register Provider"

#### SDK Provided Methods

##### The window object listens for the following events

- `ae:sdkReady` (_optional_): Invoked by `sdk` to announce the fact that it has been loaded.
- `ae:registerProvider`: Invoked by `wallet` to register with `sdk`.
- `ae:registrationComplete`: Invoked by `sdk` to let wallet know that the registration is done.
- `ae:walletDetail`: Invoked by `wallet`. This contains encrypted information about the current active account address and extra wallet methods. Everytime there is a change of address(active address) in wallet, the wallet needs to invoke this method to let the `sdk` know about the change.
- `ae:sign`: Invoked by `sdk` when required to sign the transaction.
- `ae:broadcast`: Invoked by `wallet` after it has signed the transaction.
- `ae:broadcastResponse`: Invoked by `SDK` to inform wallet about a successful or failed transaction broadcast. If there is a failure, the SDK will also provide a reason for the failure.
- `ae:deregister`: Invoked by `wallet` to deregister itself from the `sdk`.

#### Wallet Provided Methods

The wallet can also let the SDK know of extra funtionality that it provides during the time of registration. These methods will vary from wallet to wallet and are out of the scope of this proposal.

#### Workflow (Messages Exchange Example)

We're using the [JSON-RPC 2.0](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification#examples) standard for message exchange, already supported by aeternity's JS SDK.

##### Provider Registration

1. The wallet provider invokes the registration request, passing its public key.

   Message:

  ```json
    {
      "jsonrpc": "2.0",
      "method": "ae:registerProvider",
      "params": ["mqMprOIp1ehtxUI3IaG5IVJB9JTOT/yYBHm7rE+PJMY="],
      "id": null
    }
  ```

2. The SDK listens for `registerProvider` and on receiving a request generates a pub-priv key pair and broadcasts a `registrationComplete` message that includes `sdk` public key that should be used by wallet provider for all the future communications.
   Message:

  ```json
    {
      "jsonrpc": "2.0",
      "method": "ae:registrationComplete",
      "params": ["mqMprOIp1ehtxUI3IaG5IVJB9JTOT/yYBHm7rE+PJMY=", "1KGVZ2AFqAybJkpdKCzP/0W4W/0BQZaDH6en8g7VstQ="],
      "id": null
    }
  ```

3. At this step, the user should be prompted by the extension/wallet to accept the incoming SDK. If the user agrees, the wallet posts the `walletDetail` message encrypted using the secret key generated (wallet private key + sdk public key) and nonce.

   Message:

  ```json
    {
      "jsonrpc": "2.0",
      "method": "ae:walletDetail",
      "params": [ "1KGVZ2AFqAybJkpdKCzP/0W4W/0BQZaDH6en8g7VstQ=",
                "ak_bobS3qRvWfDxCpmedQYzp3xrK5jVUS4MSto99QrCdySSMjYnd",
                ...[]
              ],
      "id": null
    }
  ```

##### Transaction Signing

1. `SDK` posts the message containing `raw and unsigned transaction` encrypted with secret key generated using wallet public key and SDK private key(corresponding to the wallet provider).

   Message:

  ```json
    {
	  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
      "method": "ae:sign",
      "params": ["mqMprOIp1ehtxUI3IaG5IVJB9JTOT/yYBHm7rE+PJMY=", "raw_tx"],
      "id": null
    }
  ```

2. When the wallet receives this message it tries to decrypt it, and if successful validates and signs the transaction, re-encrypts it and again posts it for `SDK` to receive.

   Message:

  ```json
    {
      "jsonrpc": "2.0",
      "method": "ae:broadcast",
      "params": ["1KGVZ2AFqAybJkpdKCzP/0W4W/0BQZaDH6en8g7VstQ=", "raw_tx", "signed_tx"],
      "id": null
    }
   ```

3. On receiving the signed transaction back, the SDK will brodcast it and revert back to the wallet with the following message

   Message:

  ```json
    {
      "jsonrpc": "2.0",
      "method": "ae:broadcastResponse",
      "params": ["mqMprOIp1ehtxUI3IaG5IVJB9JTOT/yYBHm7rE+PJMY=", "tx_hash", "{status: ok/fail, reason?: string}"],
      "id": null
    }
   ```

## Rationale

### Encrypted Communication

- Encrypted communication layer protects the user privacy by not leaking the list of accounts to any malicious actor eavesdropping on the communication between `wallet` and `SDK`. The list of accounts is only provided to the `SDK`(in encrypted format) only if the user accepts the incoming `registrationComplete` request.
- Encryption communication also prevents any malicious actor to inject itself between the `SDK` and `wallet` and modify the requests and responses originating from either party. In other words, it prevents MITM attacks against wallets.
