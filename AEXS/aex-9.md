## Simple Summary

This document aims to outline a standard and define how fungible tokens should be created and used on aeternity blockchain.

## Abstract

The following standard allows for the implementation of a standard API for tokens within smart contracts. This standard provides basic functionality to transfer tokens, as well as allow tokens to be approved so they can be spent by another on-chain third party.


## Motivation

This standard will allow decentralized applications and wallets to handle tokens across multiple interfaces.

The most important here are `transfer`, `balance` and the `Transfer` event.

A standard interface allows any tokens to be re-used by other applications: from wallets to decentralized exchanges.

- The following specification is following the ERC20 standart introduced in Ethereum for fungible tokens.
- This standart is proven to be working and we think we can leverage of using it. It will also help us with interoperability and easier developers onboarding as the main differences will be Sophia syntax related.

## Specification

## Basic Token

### Interface

```text
contract FungibleTokenInterface =
  record meta_info =
    { name : string
    , symbol : string
    , decimals : int }
    
  datatype event =
    Transfer(indexed address, indexed address, indexed int)

  entrypoint meta_info : () => meta_info
  entrypoint total_supply : () => int
  entrypoint owner : () => address
  entrypoint balances : () => map(address, int)
  entrypoint balance : (address) => option(int)
  entrypoint transfer : (address, int) => ()
```

## Methods

### meta_info\(\)

This function **returns** meta information associated with the token contract.

```text
entrypoint meta_info() : meta_info
```

| return | type |
| :--- | :--- |
| meta_info | meta_info |

```text
record meta_info =
  { name     : string
  , symbol   : string
  , decimals : int }
```

### total_supply\(\)

This function returns the total token supply.

```text
entrypoint total_supply() : int
```

| return | type |
| :--- | :--- |
| total_supply | int |

### balances\(\)

This function returns the full balance state for static calls, e.g. by a blockchain explorer.

```text
entrypoint balances() : map(address, int)
```

| return | type |
| :--- | :--- |
| balances | map(address, int) |

### balance\(\)

This function returns the account balance of another account with address `owner`, if the account exists. If the owner address is unknown to the contract `None` will be returned. Using `option` type as a return value allows us to determine if the account has balance of 0, more than 0, or the account has never had balance and is still unknown to the contract.

```text
entrypoint balance(owner: address) : option(int)
```
| parameter | type |
| :--- | :--- |
| owner | address |

| return | type |
| :--- | :--- |
| balance | option(int) |

### transfer\(\)

This function allows transfer of `value` amount of tokens to `to_account` address and MUST fire the `Transfer` event. The function SHOULD abort if the Call.caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.

Note: Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.

```text
stateful entrypoint transfer(to_account: address, value: int) : ()
```

| parameter | type |
| :--- | :--- |
| to_account | address |
| value | int |

## Events

### **Transfer** 

This event MUST be triggered and emitted when tokens are transferred, including zero value transfers.

The transfer event arguments should be as follows: `(from_account, to_account, value)`

```text
Transfer(indexed address, indexed address, indexed int)
```

| parameter | type |
| :--- | :--- |
| from_account | address |
| to_account | address |
| value | int |

# Extensions

This section covers the extensability of the basic token - e.g. mintable, allowances.

## Extension Mintable

### mint\(\)

This function mints `value` new tokens to `account`. The function SHOULD abort if `Call.caller` is not the owner of the contract `state.owner`.

```text
stateful entrypoint mint(account: address, value: int) : ()
```

| parameter | type |
| :--- | :--- |
| account | address |
| value | int |

## Events

**Mint** - MUST trigger when tokens are minted using the `mint` function.

The mint event arguments should be as follows: `(account,  value)`

```text
Mint(indexed address, indexed int)
```

| parameter | type |
| :--- | :--- |
| account| address |
| value | int |

## Extension Allowance

### create_allowance\(\)

Allows `for_account` to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the `value` amount. If this function is called again it overwrites the current allowance with `value`.

Note: To prevent attack vectors (like the ones possible in ERC20) clients SHOULD make sure to create user interfaces in such a way that they set the allowance first to 0 before setting it to another value for the same spender. THOUGH the contract itself shouldn't enforce it, to allow backwards compatibility with contracts deployed before.

```text
stateful entrypoint create_allowance(for_account: address, value: int) : ()
```

| parameter | type |
| :--- | :--- |
| for_account| address |
| value | int |

### transfer_allowance\(\)

Transfers `value` amount of tokens from address `from_account` to address `to_account`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.

The `transfer_allowance` method is used for a withdraw workflow, allowing contracts to transfer tokens on your behalf. This can be used for example to allow a contract to transfer tokens on your behalf and/or to charge fees in sub-currencies. The function SHOULD abort unless the `from_account` account has deliberately authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism.

Note: Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.

```text
stateful entrypoint transfer_allowance(from_account: address, to_account: address, value: int)
```

| parameter | type |
| :--- | :--- |
| from_account| address |
| to_account| address |
| value | int |

### allowance\(\)

This function returns the amount which `for_account` is still allowed to withdraw from `from_account`, where `record allowance_accounts = { from_account: address, for_account: address }`. If no allowance for this combination of accounts exists, `None` is returned.

```text
entrypoint allowance(allowance_accounts : allowance_accounts) : option(int)
```

| parameter | type |
| :--- | :--- |
| allowance_accounts| allowance_accounts |

```text
record allowance_accounts =
  { from_account: address
  , for_account: address }
```

### Events

**Allowance** - MUST trigger on any successful call to `create_allowance(for_account: address, value: int)`.

The approval event arguments should be as follows: `(from_account, for_account, value)`

```text
Allowance(indexed address, indexed address, indexed int)
```

| parameter | type |
| :--- | :--- |
| from_account| address |
| for_account| address |
| value| int |

## Extension Allowance with Callback

*TODO*

## Extension Swappable

*TODO*

## Implementation
There are several implementations available at the moment, but they lack a thing or two (that is why this standard is being proposed).
