## Simple Summary

This document aims to outline a standard and define how fungible tokens should be created and used on aeternity blockchain.

## Abstract

The following standard allows for the implementation of a standard API for tokens within smart contracts. This standard provides basic functionality to transfer tokens, as well as allow tokens to be approved so they can be spent by another on-chain third party.


## Motivation

This standard will allow decentralized applications and wallets to handle fungible tokens in a standardized way.
A standard interface allows any tokens to be re-used by other applications, e.g. from wallets to decentralized exchanges.

The provided specification is following the ERC20 standard introduced in Ethereum for fungible tokens.
This standard is proven to be working, it will help with interoperability and easier developer onboarding as the main differences will be Sophia syntax related.
Another goal with following the ERC20 standard, is to learn from its mistakes and not repeat them.

The newly proposed standard should be easy to use but extendable with more functionality, both first and third party as shown by splitting allowance, minting, burning and swapping into optional extensions.

## Specification

## Basic Token

### Interface

```sophia
contract interface FungibleTokenInterface =
  record meta_info =
    { name : string
    , symbol : string
    , decimals : int }

  datatype event =
    Transfer(address, address, int)

  entrypoint aex9_extensions : ()             => list(string)
  entrypoint meta_info       : ()             => meta_info
  entrypoint total_supply    : ()             => int
  entrypoint owner           : ()             => address
  entrypoint balances        : ()             => map(address, int)
  entrypoint balance         : (address)      => option(int)
  entrypoint transfer        : (address, int) => unit
```

## Methods


### aex9_extensions\(\)

This function **returns** a hardcoded list of all implemented extensions on the deployed contract.

```sophia
entrypoint aex9_extensions() : list(string)
```

### meta_info\(\)

This function **returns** meta information associated with the token contract.

```sophia
entrypoint meta_info() : meta_info
```

| return | type |
| :--- | :--- |
| meta_info | meta_info |

```sophia
record meta_info =
  { name     : string
  , symbol   : string
  , decimals : int }
```

### total_supply\(\)

This function returns the total token supply.

```sophia
entrypoint total_supply() : int
```

| return | type |
| :--- | :--- |
| total_supply | int |

### balances\(\)

This function returns the full balance state for static calls, e.g. by a blockchain explorer.

```sophia
entrypoint balances() : map(address, int)
```

| return | type |
| :--- | :--- |
| balances | map(address, int) |

### balance\(\)

This function returns the account balance of another account with address `owner`, if the account exists. If the owner address is unknown to the contract `None` will be returned. Using `option` type as a return value allows us to determine if the account has balance of 0, more than 0, or the account has never had balance and is still unknown to the contract.

```sophia
entrypoint balance(owner: address) : option(int)
```
| parameter | type |
| :--- | :--- |
| owner | address |

| return | type |
| :--- | :--- |
| balance | option(int) |

### transfer\(\)

This function allows transfer of `value` amount of tokens to `to_account` address and MUST fire the `Transfer` event. The function SHOULD abort if the Call.caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.

Note: Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.

```sophia
stateful entrypoint transfer(to_account: address, value: int) : unit
```

| parameter | type |
| :--- | :--- |
| to_account | address |
| value | int |

## Events

### **Transfer** 

This event MUST be triggered and emitted when tokens are transferred, including zero value transfers.

The transfer event arguments should be as follows: `(from_account, to_account, value)`

```sophia
Transfer(address, address, int)
```

| parameter | type |
| :--- | :--- |
| from_account | address |
| to_account | address |
| value | int |


**Mint** (optional if token creation happens) - MUST trigger when tokens are minted and thus are newly available in the given token contract, this also applies to tokens created using the `init` method on contract creation.

The mint event arguments should be as follows: `(account,  value)`

```sophia
Mint(address, int)
```

| parameter | type |
| :--- | :--- |
| account| address |
| value | int |


# Extensions

This section covers the extendability of the basic token - e.g. mintable, burnable and allowances.

When a token contract implements an extension its name should be included in the `aex9_extensions` array, in order for third party software or contracts to know the interface.
Any extensions should be implementable without permission. Developers of extensions MUST choose a name for `aex9_extensions` that is not yet used. Developers CAN make a pull request to the reference implementation for general purpose extensions and maintainers choose to eventually include them.

## Extension Mintable ("mintable")

### mint\(\)

This function mints `value` new tokens to `account`. The function SHOULD abort if `Call.caller` is not the owner of the contract `state.owner`.

```sophia
stateful entrypoint mint(account: address, value: int) : unit
```

| parameter | type |
| :--- | :--- |
| account | address |
| value | int |

## Events

**Mint** - MUST trigger when tokens are minted and thus are newly available in the given token contract, this also applies to tokens created using the `init` method on contract creation.

The mint event arguments should be as follows: `(account,  value)`

```sophia
Mint(address, int)
```

| parameter | type |
| :--- | :--- |
| account| address |
| value | int |

## Extension Burnable ("burnable")

### burn\(\)

This function burns `value` of tokens from `Call.caller`. 

```sophia
stateful entrypoint burn(value: int) : unit
```

| parameter | type |
| :--- | :--- |
| value | int |

## Events

**Burn** - MUST trigger when tokens are burned and thus are no longer available in the given token contact.

The burn event arguments should be as follows: `(account,  value)`

```sophia
Burn(address, int)
```

| parameter | type |
| :--- | :--- |
| account| address |
| value | int |

## Extension Allowance ("allowances")

### create_allowance\(\)

Allows `for_account` to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the `value` amount. If this function is called again it overwrites the current allowance with `value`.

Note: To prevent attack vectors (like the ones possible in ERC20) clients SHOULD make sure to create user interfaces in such a way that they set the allowance first to 0 before setting it to another value for the same spender. THOUGH the contract itself shouldn't enforce it, to allow backwards compatibility with contracts deployed before.

```sophia
stateful entrypoint create_allowance(for_account: address, value: int) : unit
```

| parameter | type |
| :--- | :--- |
| for_account| address |
| value | int |

### transfer_allowance\(\)

Transfers `value` amount of tokens from address `from_account` to address `to_account`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.

The `transfer_allowance` method is used for a withdraw workflow, allowing contracts to transfer tokens on your behalf. This can be used for example to allow a contract to transfer tokens on your behalf and/or to charge fees in sub-currencies. The function SHOULD abort unless the `from_account` account has deliberately authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism.

Note: Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.

```sophia
stateful entrypoint transfer_allowance(from_account: address, to_account: address, value: int)
```

| parameter | type |
| :--- | :--- |
| from_account| address |
| to_account| address |
| value | int |

### allowance\(\)

This function returns the amount which `for_account` is still allowed to withdraw from `from_account`, where `record allowance_accounts = { from_account: address, for_account: address }`. If no allowance for this combination of accounts exists, `None` is returned.

```sophia
entrypoint allowance(allowance_accounts : allowance_accounts) : option(int)
```

| parameter | type |
| :--- | :--- |
| allowance_accounts| allowance_accounts |

```sophia
record allowance_accounts =
  { from_account: address
  , for_account: address }
```

### allowances\(\)

This function returns all allowances stored in `state.allowances` record.

```sophia
entrypoint allowances() : allowances
```

| return | type |
| :--- | :--- |
| allowances | map(allowance_accounts, int) |


### allowance_for_caller\(\)

This function will look up the allowances and return the allowed spendable amount from `from_account` for the transaction sender `Call.caller`. If there is no such allowance present result is `None`, otherwise `Some(int)` is returned with the allowance amount.

```sophia
entrypoint allowance_for_caller(from_account: address) : option(int)
```

| parameter | type |
| :--- | :--- |
| from_account| address |

| return | type |
| :--- | :--- |
|  | option(int) |

### change_allowance\(\)

This function allows the `Call.caller` to change the allowed spendable value for `for_account` with `value_change`. This adds the `value_change` to the current allowance value. If used for increasing allowance amount a positive value should be passed, if the desired outcome is to lower the value of the allowed spendable value a negative `value_change` should be passed.

```sophia
stateful entrypoint change_allowance(for_account: address, value_change: int)
```

| parameter | type |
| :--- | :--- |
| for_account | address |
| value_change | int |

| return | type |
| :--- | :--- |
|  | unit |

### reset_allowance\(\)

Resets the allowance given `for_account` to zero.

```sophia
stateful entrypoint reset_allowance(for_account: address)
```

| parameter | type |
| :--- | :--- |
| for_account| address |

| return | type |
| :--- | :--- |
|  | unit |

### Events

**Allowance** - MUST trigger on any successful allowance creation or change.

The approval event arguments should be as follows: `(from_account, for_account, value)`

```sophia
Allowance(address, address, int)
```

| parameter | type |
| :--- | :--- |
| from_account| address |
| for_account| address |
| value| int |

## Extension Swappable ("swappable")

### swap\(\)

This function burns the whole balance of the `Call.caller` and stores the same amount in the `swapped` map. 

```sophia
stateful entrypoint swap() : unit
```

| parameter | type |
| :--- | :--- |
| value | int |

| return | type |
| :--- | :--- |
| () | unit |

### check_swap\(\)

This function returns the amount of tokens that were burned trough `swap` for the provided account. 

```sophia
stateful entrypoint check_swap(account: address) : int
```

| parameter | type |
| :--- | :--- |
| account | address |

| return | type |
| :--- | :--- |
| int | int |

### swapped\(\)

This function returns all swapped tokens that are stored in contract state. 

```sophia
stateful entrypoint swapped() : map(address, int)
```

| return | type |
| :--- | :--- |
| swapped | map(address, int) |

## Events

**Swap** - MUST trigger when tokens are swapped and thus are no longer available in the given token contact.

The swap event arguments should be as follows: `(account,  value)`

```sophia
Swap(address, int)
```

| parameter | type |
| :--- | :--- |
| account| address |
| value | int |
