ATTENTION! If you would like to submit an AEX and it has already been written as
a draft (see the [template](https://github.com/aeternity/AEXs/blob/master/aex-X.md)
for an example), please submit it as a [Pull Request](https://github.com/aeternity/AEXs/pulls).

If you are considering a proposal but would like to get some feedback on the
idea before submitting a draft, then continue opening an issue as a thread for
discussion. Note that the more clearly and completely you state your idea the
higher the quality of the feedback you are likely to receive.

Keep in mind the following guidelines from [AEX-1](https://github.com/aeternity/AEXs/blob/master/AEXS/aex-1.md):

> Each AEX must have a champion - someone who writes the AEX using the style and
  format described below, shepherds the discussions in the appropriate forums,
  and attempts to build community consensus around the idea. The AEX champion
  (a.k.a. Author) should first attempt to ascertain whether the idea is AEX-
  able. Posting to the the Protocol Discussion forum or opening an issue is the
  best way to go about this.

> Before you begin, vet your idea, this will save you time. Ask the Aeternity
  community first if an idea is original to avoid wasting time on something that
  will be be rejected based on prior research (searching the Internet does not
  always do the trick). It also helps to make sure the idea is applicable to the
  entire community and not just the author. Just because an idea sounds good to
  the author does not mean it will work for most people in most areas where
  Aeternity is used. Examples of appropriate public forums to gauge interest
  around your AEX include the [Aeternity forums](https://forum.aeternity.com)
  and the issues section of this repository. In particular, the issues section
  of this repository is an excellent place to discuss your proposal with the
  community and start creating more formalised language around your AEX.

> Once the champion has asked the Aeternity community as to whether an idea has
  any chance of acceptance, a draft AEX should be presented as a pull request.
  This gives the author a chance to flesh out the draft AEX to make properly
  formatted, of high quality, and to address initial concerns about the
  proposal.
