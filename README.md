# Aeternity Expansions

The Aeternity Expansions (AEX), or aexpansions, are standards proposed by the
community at large, i.e. everyone. Some of them can be mandatory in a specific
context, e.g. [AEX-1](https://github.com/aeternity/AEXs/blob/master/AEXS/aex-1.md) describes the set of rules governing this repository, but
are restricted to the application layer.

## Goals

The purpose of this repository is to provide a high quality and accessible set
of specifications; ideally together with implementations ready to be used if
applicable.


## Contributing

If you want to contribute please follow these steps:

1. Read [AEX-1](https://github.com/aeternity/AEXs/blob/master/AEXS/aex-1.md)
2. Fork this repository
3. Add your proposal to your fork, using the template provided
4. Submit a pull request to the AEX repository

Each proposal should go into the `AEXS` directory. If you need to embed images
or other assets add a subdirectory in the `assets` directory with the number

Everything beyond step 4 is governed by [AEX-1](https://github.com/aeternity/AEXs/blob/master/AEXS/aex-1.md).
