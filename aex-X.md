This is the suggested template for new AEXs.

Note that an AEX number will be assigned by an editor. When opening a pull
request to submit your AEX, please use an abbreviated title in the filename,
`aex-draft_title_abbrev.md`.

The title should be 44 characters or less.


## Simple Summary

"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide
a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the AEX.


## Abstract

A short (~200 word) description of the technical issue being addressed.


## Motivation

The motivation should clearly explain why existing specifications are
inadequate to address the problem that the AEX solves. AEX submissions without
sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.


## Specification

The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new
or changed feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow
competing, interoperable implementations.


## Rationale

The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the
design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe
alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature
is supported in other languages. The rationale may also provide evidence of
consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or
concerns raised during discussion.


## Backwards Compatibility

All AEXs that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section
describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The AEX must explain how
the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities. AEX submissions
without a sufficient backwards compatibility treatise may be rejected outright.


## Implementation

The implementations, if applicable, must be completed before any AEX is given
status "Last Call", and it needs be completed before the AEX is accepted. There
is merit to the approach of reaching consensus on the specification and
rationale before writing code, but the principle of "rough consensus and
running code" is still useful when it comes to resolving many discussions of
API details.
